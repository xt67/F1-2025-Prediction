 F1 2025 Prediction Model

 Overview
This project is an F1 2025 Prediction Model that forecasts race results, driver standings, and team performance using data-driven machine learning techniques. The model leverages historical F1 data, weather conditions, track characteristics, and driver performance metrics to make accurate predictions. The model uses historical data to predict the F1 2025 result outcomes with a mean absolute error of 1.79 seconds.

 Features
- Predicts race results for F1 2025.
- Analyzes driver and team performance trends.
- Incorporates real-time data updates.
